# Data types and objects

R use a variety of data types. You already know most of them, actually!
Integers (\emph{nombres entiers}), floating point numbers, or floats (\emph{nombres rÃ©els}),
matrices, etc, are all objects you already use on a daily basis.
But R has a lot of other data types (that you can find in a lot of other programming languages)
that you need to become familiar with.

But first, we need to learn how to assign a variable. This can be done in two ways:

```{r}
a = 3
```

or

```{r}
a = 3
```

there is almost no difference between these two approaches. Out of habit, I use `=`, but you can
use `=` if you wish.

## The `numeric` class

To define single numbers, you can do the following:

```{r}
a = 3
```

The `class()` function allows you to check the class of an object:

```{r}
class(a)
```

Decimals are defined with the character `.}:

```{r}
a = 3.14
```

## The `character` class

Use `" "` to define characters (called strings in other programming languages):

```{r}
a = "this is a string"
```

```{r}
class(a)
```

## Vectors and matrices

You can create a vector in different ways. But first of all, it is important to understand that a
vector in most programming languages is nothing more than a list of things. These things can be
numbers (either integers or floats), strings, or even other vectors. The same applies for matrices.

### The `c()` function

matrix_a very important function that allows you to build a vector is `c()`:

```{r}
a = c(1,2,3,4,5)
```

This creates a vector with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If you check its class:

```{r}
class(a)
```

This can be confusing: you where probably expecting a to be of class \emph{vector} or
something similar. This is not the case if you use `c()` to create the vector, because `c()`
doesn't build a vector in the mathematical sense, but rather a list with numbers.
Checking its dimension:

```{r}
dim(a)
```

matrix_a list doesn't have a dimension, that's why the `dim()` command returns `NULL`. If you want to
create a true vector, you need to use `cbind()` or `rbind()`.

### `cbind()` and `rbind()`

You can create a *true* vector with `cbind()`:

```{r}
a = cbind(1,2,3,4,5)
```

Check its class now:

```{r}
class(a)
```

This is exactly what we expected. Let's check its dimension:

```{r}
dim(a)
```

This returns the dimension of `a` using the LICO notation (number of LInes first, the number of COlumns).

It is also possible to bind vectors together to create a matrix.

```{r}
b = cbind(6,7,8,9,10)
```

Now let's put vector `a` and `b` into a matrix called `matrix_c` using `rbind()`.
`rbind()` functions the same way as `cbind()` but glues the vectors together by rows and not by columns.

```{r}
matrix_c = rbind(a,b)
print(matrix_c)
```

### The `matrix` class

R also has support for matrices. For example, you can create a matrix of dimension (5,5) filled
with 0's with the `matrix()` function:

```{r}
matrix_a = matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
```

If you want to create the following matrix:

\[
B = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 2 & 4 & 3 \\
 1 & 5 & 7
\end{array} \right)
\]

you would do it like this:

```{r}
B = matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
```

The option `byrow = TRUE` means that the rows of the matrix will be filled first.

You can access individual elements of `matrix_A` like so:


```{r}
matrix_a[2, 3]
```

and R returns its value, 0. We can assign a new value to this element if we want. Try:

```{r}
matrix_a[2, 3] = 7
```

and now take a look at `matrix_a` again.

```{r}
print(matrix_a)
```

Recall our vector `b`:

```{r}
b = cbind(6,7,8,9,10)
```

To access its third element, you can simply write:

```{r}
b[3]
```

## The `logical` class

This class is the result of logical comparisons, for example, if you type:

```{r}
4 > 3
```

R returns true. If we save this in a variable `l`:

```{r}
l = 4 > 3
```

and check `l`'s class:

```{r}
class(l)
```

R returns `logical`. In other programming languages, `logical`s are often called `bool`s.

A `logical` variable can only have two values, either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.


## The `list` class

The `list` class is a very flexible class, and thus, very useful. You can put anything inside a list,
such as numbers:

```{r}
list1 = list(3, 2)
```

or vectors:

```{r}
list2 = list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
```

you can also put objects of different classes in the same list:

```{r}
list3 = list(3, c(1, 2), "lists are amazing!")
```

and of course create list of lists:

```{r}
my_lists = list(list1, list2, list3)
```

To check the contents of a list, you can use the structure function `str()`:

```{r}
str(my_lists)
```

or you can use Rstudio's *Environment* pane:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_environment_list.gif")
```

You can also create named lists:

```{r}
list4 = list("a" = 2, "b" = 8, "c" = "this is a named list")
```

and you can access the elements in two ways:

```{r}
list4[[1]]
```

or, for named lists:

```{r}
list4$c
```

Lists are used extensively because they are so flexible. You can build lists of datasets and apply
functions to all the datasets at once, build lists of models, lists of plots, etc... In the later
chapters we are going to learn all about them.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 {-}

Try to create the following vector:

\[a = (6,3,8,9)\]

and add it this other vector:

\[b = (9,1,3,5)\]

and save the result to a new variable called `result`.

### Exercise 2

Using `a` and `b` from before, try to get their dot product.

Try with `a * b` in the R console. What happened?
Try to find the right function to get the dot product. Don't hesitate to google the answer!

### Exercise 3

How can you create a matrix of dimension (30,30) filled with 2's by only using the function `matrix()`?

### Exercise 4

Save your first name in a variable `a` and your surname in a variable `b`. What does the function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
paste(a,b)
```

do? Look at the help for `paste()` with `?paste` or using the *Help* pane in Rstudio. What does the
optional argument `sep` do?

### Exercise 5

Define the following variables: `a = 8`, `b = 3`, `c = 19`. What do the following lines check?
What do they return?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a > b
a == b
a != b
a < b
(a > b) && (a < c)
(a > b) && (a > c)
(a > b) || (a < b)
```

### Exercise 6

Define the following matrix:

\[
\text{matrix_a} = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 9 & 4 & 12 \\
 5 & 0 & 7 \\
 2 & 6 & 8 \\
 9 & 2 & 9
\end{array} \right)
\]

```{r, include=FALSE}
matrix_a = matrix( c(9, 4, 12, 5, 0, 7, 2, 6, 8, 9, 2, 9), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
```

* What does `matrix_a >= 5` do?
* What does `matrix_a[ , 2]` do?
* Can you find which function gives you the transpose of this matrix?

### Exercise 7

Solve the following system of equations using the `solve()` function:

\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 9 & 4 & 12 & 2 \\
 5 & 0 & 7 & 9\\
 2 & 6 & 8 & 0\\
 9 & 2 & 9 & 11
\end{array} \right) \times \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 x \\
 y \\
 z \\
 t \\
\end{array}\right) =
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
7\\
18\\
1\\
0
\end{array}
\right)
\]


```{r, include=FALSE}
matrix_a = matrix( c(9, 4, 12, 5, 0, 7, 2, 6, 8, 9, 2, 9), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)

matrix_x = cbind(matrix_a, c(2,9,0,11))

result = c(7, 8, 1, 0)

solution = solve(matrix_x, result)
```
