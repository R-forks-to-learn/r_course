## What is R? {-}

Read R's official answer to this question
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_003f). To make it short: R is
multi-paradigm (procedural, imperative, object-oriented and functional)^[In this book we are going
to focus on R's functional programming capabilities] programming language that
focuses on applications in *statistics*. By *statistics* I mean any field that uses statistics such
as official statistics, economics, finance, data science, etc.

## Why *modern* R? {-}

*Modern* R instead of just R because we are going to learn how to use modern packages (mostly
those from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)) and concepts, such as functional
programming (which is quite an old concept actually, but one that came into fashion recently). R is
derived from S, which is a programming language that has roots in FORTRAN and other languages too.
If you learned R at university, you've probably learned to use it as you would have used FORTRAN;
very long scripts where data are represented as matrices and where row-wise (or column-wise)
operations are implemented with `for` loops. There's nothing wrong with that, mind you, but R
was also influenced by Scheme and Common Lisp, which are functional programming languages.
This means that it is really a shame not to use R's functional programming capabilities that it
inherited from these languages, because I believe that it makes writing code easier and more
natural. At its core, functional programming uses functions, and functions are so-called *first
class*  objects in R, which means that there is nothing special about them... you can pass them to
other functions, create functions that return functions and do any kind of operation on them as
with any other object. This means that functions in R are extremely powerful and flexible tools.
In the first part of the book, we are going to use functions that are already available in R, and
then use those available in packages, mostly those from the `tidyverse`. The `tidyverse` is a
collection of packages developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), and several of his colleagues
at RStudio, Inc. By using the packages from the `tidyverse` and R's built-in functional programming
capabilities, we can write code that is faster and easier to explain to colleagues, and also easier
to maintain. This also means that you might have to change your expectations and what you know
already from R, if you learned it at University but haven't touched it in a long time. For example
for and while loops, a very common and well-known concept in any programming language, are
relegated to chapter 8. This does not mean that you will have to wait for 8 chapter to know how to
repeat instructions *N* times, but that for and while loops are tools that are very useful for one
very specific kind of situation. For all the rest, they are not needed, and you will learn how to
avoid using loops.

## What is RStudio? {-}

RStudio is a modern IDE that makes writing R code easier. The first thing we are going to learn is
how to use it.
R and RStudio are both open source: this means that the source code is freely available on the internet
and contributions by anyone are welcome and integrated; provided they are meaningful and useful.

## What to expect from this book? {-}

You can't write "programming language" without "language". And just as you wouldn't expect to learn
French, Portuguese or Icelandic by reading a single book, you shouldn't expect to become fluent in R
by reading a single book, not even by reading 10 books. Programming is an art which requires a lot of
practice. [Teach yourself programming in 10 years](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html) is a blog
post written by Peter Norvig which explains that just as with any craft, mastering programming
takes time. And even if you don't need or want to become an expert in R, if you wish to use R
effectively and in a way that ultimately saves you time, you need to have some fluency in it, and
this only comes by continuing to learn about the language, and most importantly practicing. If you
keep using R every day, you'll definitely become very fluent. To stay informed about developments of
the language, and the latest news, I advise you read blogs, especially
[R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) which aggregates blog posts by more than 750 blogs
discussing R.

So what you can expect from this book is to learn enough R to make you start using it, but you'd
need to keep on reading and using R for some time to be fluent.

## Prerequisites {-}

R and RStudio are the two main pieces of software that we are going to use. R is the programming
language and RStudio is a modern IDE for it. You can use R without RStudio; but you cannot use
RStudio without R.

If you wish to install R and RStudio at home to follow the examples in this book you can do it as
both pieces of software are available free of charge (paid options for RStudio exist, for companies
that need technical support). Installation is simple, but operating system dependent. To download
and install R for Windows, follow [this link](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
For macOS, follow [this one](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). If you run a GNU+Linux
distribution, you can install R using the system's package manager. On Ubuntu, install `r-base`.

For RStudio, look for your operating system [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

## What are packages? {-}

There is one more step; we are going to install some packages. Packages are additional pieces of
code that can be installed from within R with the following function: `install.packages()`. These
packages extend R's capabilities significantly, and are probably one of the main reasons R is so
popular. As of October 2017, R has over 11000 packages.

To install the packages we need, first open RStudio and then copy and paste this line in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "checkpoint", "Ecdat", "ggthemes", "janitor", "rio", "colourpicker"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/install_packages.png")
```

or go to the **Packages** pane and then click on *Install*:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_install_packages.gif")
```

### The author {-}

My name is Bruno Rodrigues and I program almost exclusively in R and have been teaching some R
courses for a few years now (first started teaching for students at the Universit√© of Strasbourg).
These notes are an update of those I used at the time, plus a lot of things I've learned about R
since I started working at STATEC Research. I also am writing another
[book](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/) that is more advanced than this one. In my free time I
like cooking, boxing and [blogging](https://www.brodrigues.co), while listening to
[Fip](http://www.fipradio.fr/player). You can follow me on
[twitter](https://www.twitter.com/brodriguesco), I tweet mostly about R or what's happening in
Luxembourg.
