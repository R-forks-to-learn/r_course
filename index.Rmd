# What is R?

Read R's official answer to this question
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_003f). To make it short: R is
multi-paradigm (procedural, imperative, object-oriented and functional) ^[In this book we are going
to focus on R's functional programming capabilities] programming language that
focuses on applications in *statistics*. By *statistics* I mean any field that uses statistics such
as official statistics, economics, finance, data science, etc.

## Prerequisites

R and Rstudio are the two main pieces of software that we are going to use. Both are already installed
on your desktop computer. R is the programming language and Rstudio is a modern IDE for it.
R and Rstudio are both open source: this means that the source code is freely available on the internet
and contributions by anyone are welcome and integrated; provided they are meaningful and useful.

If you wish to install R and Rstudio at home to follow the examples in this book you can do it as
both pieces of software are available free of charge (for firms paid options for Rstudio exist).
Installation is simple, but operating system dependent. To download and install R for Windows,
follow [this link](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
For macOS, follow [this one](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). If you run a GNU+Linux
distribution, you can install R using the system's package manager. On Ubuntu, install `r-base`.

For Rstudio, look for your operating system [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

## What are packages?

There is one more step; we are going to install some packages. Packages are additional pieces of
code that can be installed from within R with the following function: `install.packages()`. These
packages extend R's capabilities significantly, and are probably one of the main reasons R is so
popular. As of October 2017, R has over 11000 packages.

To install the packages we need, first open Rstudio and then copy and paste this line in the console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "checkpoint", "eurostat", "ggthemes", "janitor", "openxlsx"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/install_packages.png")
```

or go to the **Packages** pane and then click on *Install*:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_install_packages.gif")
```
