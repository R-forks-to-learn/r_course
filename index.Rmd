## What is R? {-}

Read R's official answer to this question
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_003f). To make it short: R is
multi-paradigm (procedural, imperative, object-oriented and functional) ^[In this book we are going
to focus on R's functional programming capabilities] programming language that
focuses on applications in *statistics*. By *statistics* I mean any field that uses statistics such
as official statistics, economics, finance, data science, etc.

## Why *modern* R? {-}

*Modern* R instead of just R because we are going to learn how to use modern packages and concepts,
such as functional programming (which is quite an old concept actually, but one that came into
fashion recently). R is derived from S, which is a programming language that has roots in FORTRAN
and Scheme. If you learned R at university, you've probably learned to use it as you would have
used FORTRAN; very long scripts where data are represented as matrices and where row-wise
(or column-wise) operations are implemented with `for` loops. There's nothing wrong with that, mind
you, but it is a shame not to use R's functional programming capabilities that it inherited from
Scheme, because I believe that it makes writing code easier and more natural. At its core, functional
programming uses functions, and functions are first class objects in R. We are going to learn what
that means later. First, we are going to use functions that are already available in R, and then
use those available in packages, mostly those from the `tidyverse`. The `tidyverse` is a collection
of packages developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). By using the packages from the
`tidyverse` and R's built-in functional programming capabilities, we can write code that is faster
and easier to explain to colleagues, and also easier to maintain. This also means that you might
have to change your expectations and what you know already from R, if you learned it at University
but haven't touched it in a long time.

## What is Rstudio? {-}

Rstudio is a modern IDE that makes writing R code easier. The first thing we are going to learn is
how to use it.
R and Rstudio are both open source: this means that the source code is freely available on the internet
and contributions by anyone are welcome and integrated; provided they are meaningful and useful.

## Prerequisites {-}

R and Rstudio are the two main pieces of software that we are going to use. Both are already installed
on your desktop computer. R is the programming language and Rstudio is a modern IDE for it. You can
use R without Rstudio; but you cannot use Rstudio without R.

If you wish to install R and Rstudio at home to follow the examples in this book you can do it as
both pieces of software are available free of charge (for firms paid options for Rstudio exist).
Installation is simple, but operating system dependent. To download and install R for Windows,
follow [this link](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
For macOS, follow [this one](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). If you run a GNU+Linux
distribution, you can install R using the system's package manager. On Ubuntu, install `r-base`.

For Rstudio, look for your operating system [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

## What are packages? {-}

There is one more step; we are going to install some packages. Packages are additional pieces of
code that can be installed from within R with the following function: `install.packages()`. These
packages extend R's capabilities significantly, and are probably one of the main reasons R is so
popular. As of October 2017, R has over 11000 packages.

To install the packages we need, first open Rstudio and then copy and paste this line in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "checkpoint", "Ecdat", "ggthemes", "janitor", "rio", "colourpicker"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/install_packages.png")
```

or go to the **Packages** pane and then click on *Install*:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_install_packages.gif")
```

### The author {-}

My name is Bruno Rodrigues and I work in the research department of STATEC. I program almost
exclusively in R and have been teaching some R courses for a few years now (first started teaching
for students at the Universit√© of Strasbourg). These notes are an update of those I used at the
time, plus a lot of things I've learned about R since I started working at STATEC. I also am writing
another [book](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/) that is more advanced than this one. In my free
time I like cooking, boxing and [blogging](https://www.brodrigues.co). You can follow me
on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/brodriguesco) if you'd like!
