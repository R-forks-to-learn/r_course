Before merging these datasets together, we would need them to have a `year` column indicating the
year. It would also be helpful if gave names to these datasets. For this task, we can use
`purrr::set_names()`:

```{r}
all_datasets = set_names(all_datasets, as.character(seq(2013, 2016)))
```

Let's take a look at the list now:

```{r}
str(all_datasets)
```

As you can see, each `data.frame` object contained in the list has been renamed. You can thus
access them with the `$` operator:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/all_datasets_names.png")
```
