Read R’s official answer to this question here. To make it short: R is multi-paradigm (procedural, imperative, object-oriented and functional)1 programming language that focuses on applications in statistics. By statistics I mean any field that uses statistics such as official statistics, economics, finance, data science, etc. 1.1 Prerequisites R and Rstudio are the two main pieces of software that we are going to use. Both are already installed on your desktop computer. R is the programming language and Rstudio is a modern IDE for it. R and Rstudio are both open source: this means that the source code is freely available on the internet and contributions by anyone are welcome and integrated; provided they are meaningful and useful. If you wish to install R and Rstudio at home to follow the examples in this book you can do it as both pieces of software are available free of charge (for firms paid options for Rstudio exist). Installation is simple, but operating system dependent. To download and install R for Windows, follow this link. For macOS, follow this one. If you run a GNU+Linux distribution, you can install R using the system’s package manager. On Ubuntu, install r-base. For Rstudio, look for your operating system here. 1.2 What are packages? There is one more step; we are going to install some packages. Packages are additional pieces of code that can be installed from within R with the following function: install.packages(). These packages extend R’s capabilities significantly, and are probably one of the main reasons R is so popular. As of October 2017, R has over 11000 packages. To install the packages we need, first open Rstudio and then copy and paste this line in the console: install.packages(c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;checkpoint&quot;, &quot;eurostat&quot;, &quot;ggthemes&quot;, &quot;janitor&quot;, &quot;openxlsx&quot;)) In this book we are going to focus on R’s functional programming capabilities↩ "],
