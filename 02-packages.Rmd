# Packages

You can think of packages as addons that extend R's core functionality. You can browse all available
packages on [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/). To make it easier to find what you might be
interested in, you can also browse the [CRAN Task Views](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/views/).
Each package has a landing page that summarises its dependencies, version number etc. For example,
for the `dplyr` package: [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html).
Take a look at the *Downloads* section, and especially at the Reference Manual and Vignettes:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/packages_vignette.png")
```

Vignettes are valuable documents; inside vignettes, the purpose of the package is explained in
plain English, usually with accompanying examples. The reference manuals list the available functions
inside the packages. You can also find vignettes from within Rstudio:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_vignette.gif")
```

Go to the *Packages* pane and click on the package you're interested in. Then you can consult the
help for the functions that come with the package as well as the package's vignettes.

Once you installed a package, you have to load it before you can use it. To load packages you use the
`library()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
# and so on...
```

If you only need to use one single function once, you don't need to load an entire package. You can
write the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dplyr::full_join(A, B)
```

using the `::` operator, you can access functions from packages without having to load the whole
package beforehand.

It is possible and easy to create your own packages. This is useful if you have to write a lot of
functions that you use daily. This is outside the scope of this book, but if you're interested
you can read this [other one](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/packages.html) I wrote.
