# Graphs

By default, it is possible to make a lot of graphs with R without the need of any external
packages. However, in this chapter, we are going to learn how to make graphs using `ggplot2` which
is a very powerful package that produces amazing graphs. There is an entry cost to `ggplot2` as it
works in a very different way than what you would expect. But the resulting graphs are well worth
the effort.
