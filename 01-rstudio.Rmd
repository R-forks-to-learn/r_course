# Getting to know Rstudio

Rstudio is a modern IDE that makes writing R code easier. In this chapter, we will learn about some
of Rstudio's most useful features.

## Panes

Rstudio is divided into different panes. Each pane has a specific function. The gif below shows
some of these panes:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_panes.gif")
```

Take some time to look around what each pane shows you. Some panes are empty; for example the *Plots*
pane or the *Viewer* pane. *Plots* shows you the plots you make. You can browse the plots and save
them. We will see this in more detail in a later chapter. *Viewer* shows you previews of documents
that you generate with R. More on this later.

Look at the gif below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_new_script.gif")
```

In this gif, we see the user creating a new R script. R scripts are simple text files that hold R
code. Think of `.do` files in STATA or `.c` files for C. R scripts have the extension `.r` or `.R`.

## Options

It is also possible to customize Rstudio's look and feel:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_options.gif")
```

Take some time to go through the options.

## Keyboard shortcuts

It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with at least some keyboard shortcuts. This is more
convenient than having to move the mouse around:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_shortcuts.gif")
```

If there is only one keyboard shortcut you need to know, it's `Ctrl-Enter` that executes a line of code
from your script.
